# BoardGame

My board game project written in Python. discord is a bot in discord who acts like a narrator for my game. SteveBoardGameAlpha_v1.0 is completly python based version using socket stuff with no discord and other stuff. Prototypes are incomplete and only shows the concept of my game.

# Rules
Who's the spy

Normally there would be 6 people playing this game, 2 of them will be spies, others are innocents. when the game starts, everyone gets a card with a word on it. 
For innocents it will be a normal word, but for spies, they won't have any word. Note that spies won't know each other
Everyone will describe their word, but since spies don't have a word, so they'll have to guess the word from other's description and try their best to pretend that they know the word.
When a round ends, players will start a vote. The player gets the most vote will die. player reveals their identity when they die(not their word but if they are spy or not)
When it's spy's turn or a spy dies, he can choose to guess the word. If he got the right word, spy automatically wins, otherwise they die.
If all the spy dies, innocent wins. if all the innocent dies, spy wins. if there are only two players left, and one of them is a spy, spy wins as well.
